Here’s a detailed breakdown for creating CTF challenges in SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) challenge involving packet capture for a beginner to intermediate audience.

SQL Injection Challenges

Challenge 1: Basic Login Bypass (Beginner)

Objective: Use SQL injection to bypass a login page.

Steps:

	1.	Set Up Database: Create a simple table users with columns username, password.
	2.	Create a Login Page: Develop a login form with fields for username and password.
	3.	Introduce Vulnerability: Write the SQL query without input sanitization:

SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$username' AND password = '$password';


	4.	Goal: Allow the user to log in as any user by injecting a payload like admin' OR '1'='1.
	5.	Testing: Check that inputs like admin' OR '1'='1 bypass authentication.
	6.	Hints: Provide a hint such as “try adding OR '1'='1 to the input.”

Challenge 2: Data Extraction with Union Injection (Beginner/Intermediate)

Objective: Retrieve hidden data using UNION injection.

Steps:

	1.	Database Expansion: Add another table, like credit_cards, with fake sensitive data.
	2.	Search Page: Create a vulnerable search field, such as:

SELECT product_name, price FROM products WHERE product_name = '$input';


	3.	Goal: Extract hidden data using UNION:

' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users --


	4.	Testing: Ensure UNION statements expose data.
	5.	Hints: Suggest trying UNION to retrieve hidden information.
	6.	Hint for Progress: Offer syntax tips if they struggle with UNION.


Challenge 3: Boolean-Based Blind SQL Injection (Intermediate)

Objective: Learn Boolean-based SQL injection to retrieve sensitive data.

Steps:

	1.	Set Up Form: Create a search or login form with no error feedback.
	2.	Vulnerable Query: Introduce a query where output changes based on the injected condition:

SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$username' AND password = '$password';


	3.	Goal: The user should determine username values by manipulating true/false conditions.
	4.	Testing: Test with injections like ' OR username='admin to confirm true/false behavior.
	5.	Hints: Offer hints on using OR conditions to check for true/false responses.
	6.	Hint for Progress: Point to IF conditions if they struggle with Boolean logic.

XSS Challenges

Challenge 1: Reflected XSS on a Search Page (Beginner)

Objective: Perform a reflected XSS attack by injecting JavaScript.

Steps:

	1.	Create a Search Page: Build a search form that displays user input on the results page.
	2.	Vulnerable Code: Print user input directly in HTML without filtering:

<p>Results for: <?php echo $_GET['query']; ?></p>


	3.	Goal: Trigger an alert with <script>alert(1)</script>.
	4.	Testing: Ensure <script> tags execute in the output.
	5.	Hints: Guide the user to try <script> tags for JavaScript execution.

Challenge 2: Stored XSS in a Comment Section (Intermediate)

Objective: Exploit stored XSS to impact all viewers.

Steps:

	1.	Create a Comment Form: Set up a form to save comments, stored without sanitization.
	2.	Vulnerability: Display comments on the page without sanitizing the output:

echo $comment['text'];


	3.	Goal: Inject <script>alert('XSS')</script> to confirm stored XSS.
	4.	Testing: Confirm that stored XSS affects all users viewing the page.
	5.	Hints: Suggest trying script tags in the comment box.
	6.	Hint for Progress: Offer a tip if they need help finding comment inputs.

Challenge 3: Bypass XSS Filter with Alternative Tags (Intermediate)

Objective: Bypass basic XSS filters using alternative tags.

Steps:

	1.	Add Basic Filter: Block <script> tags but allow other attributes.
	2.	Input Field: Display unfiltered user input on the page.
	3.	Goal: Inject JavaScript with an alternative like:

<img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS')">


	4.	Testing: Ensure alternative tags like <img> trigger XSS.
	5.	Hints: Suggest using non-script tags for JavaScript.
	6.	Hint for Progress: Indicate that image tags may work for bypass.

Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Challenge: Capture Session Token from Packet Capture (Beginner)

Objective: Capture a session token from a .pcap file using Wireshark.

Steps:

	1.	Set Up HTTP Session: Create a basic HTTP login that transmits a session token in clear text.
	2.	Capture Network Traffic: Use Wireshark to capture the HTTP traffic of the session, ensuring the session token is included in the HTTP headers (e.g., Cookie: session_token=ABC123).
	3.	Save Capture File: Export the capture as a .pcap file, making sure the HTTP packet with the session token is included.
	4.	Instructions for Participants: Provide instructions for opening the .pcap file in Wireshark, using filters (http.cookie) to locate the session token.
	5.	Goal: Participants should locate the session token in the capture file.
	6.	Hints: Suggest using the http.cookie filter in Wireshark to find the session token.
	7.	Hint for Progress: Guide participants to look at HTTP GET and POST packets if they struggle.
